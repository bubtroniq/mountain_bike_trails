                <p class="description">From easy trails to more demanding routes, mountain bike enthusiasts can experience a lot of adrenaline on the Romanian roads and mountain trails. In Transylvania, MTB enthusiasts have over 200 km of marked routes, which can be covered in stages. The bike routes around Brașov are well known and promoted in most tourists guides, while Țara Hațegului displays a wide network of unmarked routes that you can try in any season. Whichever route you choose, exploring Romania on a mountain bike is fun!

            <p class="description">Romania compensates for the lack of a well-defined network of cycling routes through a generous offer of secondary roads, forest roads, or wide mountain trails in the alpine meadows that are perfectly suited for self-planned mountain bike tours. There are few local bike signs or bike maps; instead, you can bike freely, and following the classic mountain signs will always keep you on the right track. Exploring Romania on a mountain bike is an adventure that no one should avoid.

            <p class="description">
                Whatever region you choose, with rigorous route planning and a physical or digital map, you should be OK to bike for hundreds of miles. However, there are two official routes that can be considered as the greatest challenge for mountain bikers that cross Romania: Via Transilvanica and the last segment of EuroVelo 6.
                
                From north to south, from the land of the monasteries in Bucovina, through the wide valleys and over the bucolic hills of Transylvania, passing the Carpathians on the ancient transhumance routes, to reach the surprising landscape on the Danube, the Via Transilvanica route covers about 1400km. You pass through bigger cities, but you mainly cross rural ​​Romania. The route is not necessarily a cycle trail, but one recommended for both hikers and cyclists. Of course, apart from the starting point - Putna Monastery, and the ending one - Drobeta-Turnu Severin, nothing is nailed down, and between them, you can customize your route as you like.

                <p class="description">
                    EuroVelo 6 covers Southern Romania, approximately from Buziaș, where the Danube enters the country to the resorts on the Romanian coast. A mostly flat route, but not at all easy, and by no means boring, which takes you through areas barely known to mass tourism. From the unique landscape of the Danube Gorges, passing through villages bathed by the scorching sun in the Romanian Plain, leaving behind abandoned silos and disused factories in Bărăgan, the EuroVelo route invariably ends with a swim in the Black Sea</p>

            <p class="description">
                To discover the less-known Transylvania, the mountain bike routes in the Jiu Valley or the roads in Țara Hațegului are among the most suitable. Near Petroșani you have a lot of mountain bike trails,  well-documented by the local cycling community.
                
                In Hunedoara, the roads take you to important tourist attractions, through a unique landscape, rich with natural attractions (Băniței Gorges, Fundatura Ponorului, Grădiștea Muncelului-Cioclovina Natural Park). At the end of a bike route, you can enjoy the local cuisine, visit the small local museums, and everything that Dinosaur Land has to offer.
